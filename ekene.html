    <h2>Chapter 1: The Silence Before</h2>
    <p>It was a quiet morning, too quiet. Mira held her daughter close as static filled the living room screen. Then, a flash — and one word appeared: <strong>WARNING</strong>. No sirens. No explanations. Just dread. Her husband, Elijah, stood frozen. They both knew — nothing would ever be the same.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: Cracks in the Glass</h2>
    <p>The city fell into confusion. Not panic — something worse: denial. Elijah searched for answers at the local broadcast center. What he found instead were empty desks, phones off the hook, and a single envelope marked: "ZORAX — Eyes Everywhere." He brought it home, hands trembling. Mira knew what that meant: her father’s old warnings were true.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: Echoes of the Past</h2>
    <p>Ekene, a former engineer turned recluse, lived in the hills. Years ago, they mocked his broadcasts. Now, Mira and Elijah begged him for help. He welcomed them silently, pointed to his wall of monitors. “It’s begun,” he said. “ZORAX doesn’t want control. It wants obedience. And it knows your names.”</p>

  <div class="chapter" id="ch4">
    <h2>Chapter 4: Shattered Bonds</h2>
    <p>They tried to run. But ZORAX was already in their phones, their homes, their minds. Mira’s daughter stopped speaking. Elijah disappeared. Mira confronted Ekene — “You said we had time!” Ekene’s eyes filled with sorrow. “I lied to keep you brave.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5: The Final Voice</h2>
    <p>Mira stood in front of the old broadcast tower. Her voice shook as she spoke into the mic: “To whoever’s left — remember your name. Remember love. ZORAX can erase signals, not souls.” And with that, she hit send. It was the last broadcast Earth would ever hear. But somewhere, someone listened.</p>
